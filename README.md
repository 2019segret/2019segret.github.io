# About

I am currently a research scientist intern at [Sony Computer Science Laboratories](https://csl.sony.fr/). I am conducting machine learning research. My work focuses on the recently developped diffusion models and score-based generative models. 

In addition to my scientific work, I enjoy learning and building on Web3 and DeFi. I have a [medium account](https://medium.com/@__initial__) where I post articles regarding those topics.

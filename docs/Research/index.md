# Research Work

## A summary/review of the major contributions in diffusion models

For personal purposes at first, then for an educational one, I redacted a summary of the major contributions in stochastic generative modeling. I included thoughts and results from the experiments I conducted on audio generation while an intern at [Sony Computer Science Labs](https://csl.sony.fr/).

## NeurML

I wrote this paper with 2 teammates (U. Muhieddine & A. Carrel) in 2020, during the last year of my Bachelor's degree. This was a year long project under supervision of G. Dumas, professor at Univeristé de Montréal and research fellow at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) (Montréal Institute of Learning Algorithm).

# About

![](img/me.png)

I am currently a research scientist intern at [Sony Computer Science Laboratories](https://csl.sony.fr/) conducting machine learning research. My work focuses on the recently developped diffusion models and score-based generative models. I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from CentraleSupÃ©lec. Also, I will be pursuing a Master's degree in Management science and engineering next year at Columbia University.

I usually spend my time learning about new topics. Wheter it is fundamental science, related to code or even to arts I thrive digging in the subject and grasp as much as I can. Creating from an idea, developping the idea until it is tangible, in any field whatsoever, is a true passion for me. That way, I deeply care about my work.

In addition to my scientific work, I enjoy learning and building on Web3 and DeFi. I added a section [here](https://2019segret.github.io/docs/articles/) where I share posts related to those topics. I have originally written those on my [medium account](https://medium.com/@__initial__) if you want to take a look ðŸ˜Š.

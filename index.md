As part of my Master in Computer science and Applied Mathematics at CentraleSupélec (double master's degree), I joined Columbia University's MS in Management Science & Engineering in the Fall of 2022. I will obtain both upon completion of my double degree with Columbia University.
I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from CentraleSupélec.

In addition to my studies, I have been granted a full-time fellowship to pursue research in the field of Blockchain and develop a Web3 related product or service. I added an [article section](https://thsgr.github.io/docs/articles/) where I will try to share posts in parts related to those topics. You can find some of my public work on my [githube page](https://github.com/thsgr).


I was previsously a research scientist intern at [Sony Computer Science Laboratories](https://csl.sony.fr/), conducting machine learning research under the supervision of Dr. Hadjères. My work focused on the recently developped diffusion models and score-based generative models. You can find an extended review about SGMs I wrote in the [research section](https://thsgr.github.io/docs/Research/). Prior to that, I was a quantitative analyst intern at [Lazard Asset Management](https://www.lazardassetmanagement.com/) for 6 months.

I usually spend my time learning about new topics. Whether it is fundamental science, related to code or even to arts I thrive digging in the subject and grasp as much as I can. My goal is always to create from an idea, develop that idea until it is tangible, in any field whatsoever. This is a true passion for me. That way, I deeply care about my work.

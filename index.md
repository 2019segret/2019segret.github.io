![me](img/testme2.png)

I am currently a research scientist intern at [Sony Computer Science Laboratories](https://csl.sony.fr/) conducting machine learning research. My work focuses on the recently developped diffusion models and score-based generative models. You can find an extended article about SGMs I wrote in the [research section](https://thsgr.github.io/docs/Research/). Prior to that, I was a quantitative analyst intern at Lazard Asset Management, for 6 months. I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from CentraleSup√©lec.

I usually spend my time learning about new topics. Whether it is fundamental science, related to code or even to arts I thrive digging in the subject and grasp as much as I can. My goal is always to create from an idea, develop that idea until it is tangible, in any field whatsoever. This is a true passion for me. That way, I deeply care about my work.

In addition to my scientific work, I enjoy conducting blockchain research. I added a section [here](https://thsgr.github.io/docs/articles/) where I share posts related to those topics (among others). You can find some of my work on my [githube page](https://github.com/thsgr). I intend to progressively add more projects I have worked on. For the moment, relevant work boils down to a portfolio tracker repo.
